% Stability

**TODO.**

  - initial focus on $\dot{x} = f(t,x)$, so that later we can consider
    $\dot{x} = f(x, u), \; y = g(x, u)$: even if there is no explicit
    $t$, there is a time-dependency through $u$. 
    Work on the well-posedness stuff here.

  - make a try at minimal differential geometry? Would be nice.
    Example being the pendulum, better example is the evolution 
    of rigid bodies. Approach through non-singular constraint 
    functions and embedding in $\mathbb{R}^n$ ?
    Need to 'extend' the rhs to some neighbourghood of the manifold
    somehow, but the precise extension does not matter, this is nice.
    And in the examples I have in mind, it's pretty easy to build that
    extension ... The issue when talking about additional structure
    is about compactness? Compact sets in the manifolds are NOT
    traces of compact sets. Do they have an simple characterization
    (beyond sequences ?)?

  - try Laplace for rational "function" (or generalized) only ?
    Dunno really. Dirac as the limit of short-time constant 
    exponential? Does it make sense? Think of use cases.
    At least I'd like to talk about impulse response.


Initial-Value Problem
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Context:

$$
\dot{x} = f(x)
$$

where $f: U \subset \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$, $U$ open.
(Q: open domain $D$ instead ? Nota: we cannot expect global attracitivity
unless $U$ is connected ...)
The Caratheodory conditions that ensure uniqueness and 
(local) existence everywhere are met (reduce to locally 
Lipschitz here, right ?). 

(Q: focus on $U = \mathbb{R}^n$ ?)

Nota: ODEs as integral equations.

(autonomous ODES only so far ...)

(Nota: (embedded) manifolds ? Probably not realistic.)

Notation for the solution:

$x(t)$ or $x(t, x_0)$ or even $x(t, t_0, x_0)$ when needed
(depends on the emphasis that is needed).

Nota: local existence and uniqueness means (consequence) 
that for any $x_0$, the trajectory is
defined on a maximal time interval $\left[0, t_{\infty}\right[$
where $t_{\infty} \in \left]0, +\infty \right]$ and that
when $t_{\infty} < +\infty$, the solution "approaches the 
boundary of $U$ or $\infty$" (find the more palatable variant to
say that it doesn't stay in any compact subset of $U$; subsequence
such that $d(x_n, \partial U) \to 0$ or $|x_n| \to +\infty$ ?
Examples in each case ...)

Note: global existence first prerequisite for (global) attractivity.



Equilibrium
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stability
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  - Assume that we have already handled equilibrium concept, 
    explain why having set the right equilibrium is not good enough.
    We search for some "robustness".

  - Focus on global concepts first (local later)

  - Focus on asymptotic stability

  - Start with attractivity (the "natural" definition)
  
  - Show its shortcoming: given a target precision, we can't tell
    how much time is needed to get it "convergence speed"

  - Example

  - Small progress: we cannot expect a complete uniformity of the
    convergence: consider IV farther away, that makes sense that
    such trajectories cannot meet the same objective in the same
    amount of time; consider IV near the boundary as a more subtle
    example of the same case.

  - Define (G)AS as the uniform convergence towards the equiibrium 
    wrt any set of initial condition far from infinity and the
    boundary.

  - Extra (optional): we only need to require a "local" uniformity
    around any IV point to make it work.


(Global) attractivity (0 being an equilibrium):

  $$
  \mbox{for every } x_0 \in U, \; 
  \lim_{t \to +\infty} x(t, x_0) = 0
  $$

same as

  $$
  \forall \, \epsilon > 0, \;
  \forall \, x_0 \in U, \;
  \exists \, t_0 > 0, \;
  \forall \, t \geq t_0, \;
  |x(t, x_0)| < \epsilon.
  $$

(nota: hence (global) attractivity implicitly requires that for every
initial value in $U$, the solution is defined for all $t$)

But this concept does not preclude the trajectory to take an arbitrary
long time to meet the (approximate) target.

Exemple: (polar coords): $\dot{r} = r(1-r)$, $\dot{\theta} = \sin^2 \theta/2$,
$U = \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{0\}$, the only equilibrium is $(1,0)$, it is
attractive but not stable. May represent the "quiver" plot and the
evolution of the angle for initial values with $r=1$ and small but
positive angles.

Therefore, a stronger version of attractivity: we require the
condition above to be met locally uniformly wrt the initial 
condition (in a neighbourhood of every points, the trajectories
converge "at the same speed" to the origin):
  $$
  \forall \, \epsilon > 0, \;
  \forall \, x_0 \in U, \;
  \exists \, \delta > 0,
  \exists \, t_0 > 0, \;
  \forall \, t \geq t_0, \;
  \forall \, x_1 \in U, \;
  |x_1 - x_0| < \delta \; 
  \rightarrow
  |x(t, x_1)| < \epsilon.
  $$

Equivalently (compactness argument):
  $$
  \forall \, \epsilon > 0,
  \forall \, K \subset U, \; K \, \mbox{compact}, \;
  \exists \, t_0 > 0, \;
  \forall \, x_0 \in K, \;
  \forall \, t \geq t_0, \;
  |x(t, x_0)| < \epsilon.
  $$

Nota: this condition above clearly yields attractivity (D'oh!) AND stability.
Conversely, if we assume that the system is globally asymptotically stable,
then the appropriate Lyapunov converse theorem gives us a smooth 
definite positive function $V(x)$ with a definite negative 
$\dot{V}(x)$ 
and with compact sublevel sets 
$\{x \in U \, | \, V(x) \leq v\}$ for any $v \in \mathbb{R}$.
Any compact subset $K$ of $U$ is included in some of these sets
(consider an appropriate local open cover of $K$, 
max $V$ over each neighbourhood -- compactly included in $U$ --,
extract a finite cover, etc.)
so we may assume take a "new" (possibly larger) $K$ whih is the 
sublevel set associated to some value $v_0$.
Now, define
  $$
  \alpha(v) = \min \{-\dot{V}(x) \, | \, v \leq V(x) \leq v_0\}
  $$
for $v>0$ and $\alpha(0)$. The funcion $\alpha$ is continous,
zero only for $x = 0$ and non-decreasing. 
By construction, we also have $\dot{V}(x) \leq - \alpha(V(x))$.
Now, since the sublevels sets of $V$ are a neighbourhood basis 
of $0$, all we have to do is to prove that,
  $$
  \lim_{t \to + \infty} \max_{x_0} \{V(x(t, x_0)) \; | \; V(x_0) \leq v_0 \} = 0.
  $$ 
If the limit was positive instead, say $v_1$, since $V(x(t, x_0))$ 
is non-increasing wrt $t$, we would have $v_1 \leq V(x(t, x_0))$ for
all $t$, all thus $\dot{V}(x(t, x_0)) \leq -\alpha(v_1)$ for all $t$,
which would yield a contradiction.
